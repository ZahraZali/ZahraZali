# 👋 Hi, I'm Zahra Zali  

🎓 Postdoctoral Researcher in Geophysics | 🧠 Machine Learning for Seismology | 🌋 Earthquake & Volcano Research  

---

## 🔬 About Me  
- I develop **signal processing and machine learning algorithms** for time series data such as seismic and strainmeter records. 
- My research focuses on **earthquake and volcanic preparatory processes**, with particular emphasis on **tremor signals** and **Slow Slip Events (SSEs)**.  
- My goal is to advance **data-driven seismology** to improve our understanding of **fault slip and deformation processes**, and to move toward more reliable **earthquake and eruption forecasting**.
